  1. Pull down this repo

1. Run the script that's in the SQL folder. This will create the Sunnie database.
1. You will need to set up a Firebase account: do the follow steps in the firebase console:

   - Go to [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) and add a new project. You can name it whatever you want (Sunnie is a good name)
   - Go to the Authentication tab, click "Set up sign in method", and enable the Username and Password option.
   - Add at least two new users in firebase. Use email addresses that you find in the UserProfile table of your SQL Server database
   - Once firebase creates a UID for these users, copy the UID from firebase and update the `FirebaseId` column for the same users in your SQL Server database.
   - Click the Gear icon in the sidebar to go to Project Settings. You'll need the information on this page for the next few steps

1. Go to the `appSettings.Local.json.example` file. Replace the value for FirebaseProjectId with your own

1. Rename the `appSettings.Local.json.example` file to remove the `.example` extension. This file should now just be called `appSettings.Local.json`

1. Open your `client` directory in VsCode. Open the `.env.local.example` file and replace `__YOUR_API_KEY_HERE__` with your own firebase Web API Key

1. Rename the `.env.local.example` file to remove the `.example` extension. This file should now just be called `.env.local`

1. Install your dependencies by running `npm install` from the same directory as your `package.json` file

  Now you can follow the [installation instructions](#instructions-for-installing-Sunnie) to get Sunnie up and running on your machine.

  This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
