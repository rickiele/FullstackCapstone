 # Set Up and Installation Instructions

  You will need to have command line tools installed for your computer to use terminal commands.

  Linux/ Windows users, please visit the [Git page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and follow the instructions for set up

  Mac users follow the instructions below

  Open your terminal and type
  ```sh
    git --version
  ```

  You will now need to configure your git account. In the terminal window, type:
  ```sh
    git config -global user.name "Your Name"
    git config -global user.email "Your Email"
  ```

  If you do not have Node.js installed on your machine, visit the [Node.js Download Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and  follow the instructions. To ensure that it is installed correctly, in your terminal window, type
  ```sh
    echo $PATH
  ```
  Ensure that the result has the following in the $PATH
  ```sh
    /usr/local/bin
    or
    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
  ```
  1. Pull down this repo

1. Run the script that's in the SQL folder. This will create the Sunnie database.
1. You will need to set up a Firebase account: do the follow steps in the firebase console:

   - Go to [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) and add a new project. You can name it whatever you want (Sunnie is a good name)
   - Go to the Authentication tab, click "Set up sign in method", and enable the Username and Password option.
   - Add at least two new users in firebase. Use email addresses that you find in the UserProfile table of your SQL Server database
   - Once firebase creates a UID for these users, copy the UID from firebase and update the `FirebaseId` column for the same users in your SQL Server database.
   - Click the Gear icon in the sidebar to go to Project Settings. You'll need the information on this page for the next few steps

1. Go to the `appSettings.Local.json.example` file. Replace the value for FirebaseProjectId with your own

1. Rename the `appSettings.Local.json.example` file to remove the `.example` extension. This file should now just be called `appSettings.Local.json`

1. Open your `client` directory in VsCode. Open the `.env.local.example` file and replace `__YOUR_API_KEY_HERE__` with your own firebase Web API Key

1. Rename the `.env.local.example` file to remove the `.example` extension. This file should now just be called `.env.local`

1. Install your dependencies by running `npm install` from the same directory as your `package.json` file

  Now you can follow the [installation instructions](#instructions-for-installing-Sunnie) to get Sunnie up and running on your machine.

  This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
